\subsection{Case Converter}
\textbf{Problem Statement:}\\
Convert a given text into different cases as mentioned below
\begin{description}
	\item[aLtErNaTiNg CaPs] Start with a lower case letter and then keep switching between upper case and lower case letters alternatingly.
	\item[Capitalize Word] Capitalize the first letter of each word and convert all other letters of that word to lower case.
	\item[lower case] Convert every alphabet to lower case.
	\item[Sentence case] Capitalize the first letter of each sentence and convert all other letters of that sentence to lower case. Assume that the sentence only ends with a full stop (`.') .
	\item[tOGGLE cASE] Uncapitalize the first letter of each word and convert all other letters of that word to upper case.
	\item[UPPER CASE] Convert every alphabet to upper case.
\end{description}
\begin{note}
	In all above cases, ignore non-alphabetic characters.

\subsection{Spiral Grid}
\textbf{Problem Statement:}\\
Generate a grid containing numbers from $1$ to $n^2$ such that $1$ is at center and then the numbers spiral outwards from $1$ in counterclockwise direction. Also, make sure each element of grid is equally spaced as shown in \ref{fig:spiralgrid}.
\begin{note}
	If $n$ is even then choose the left-bottom element from the four possible centers.

\subsection{Minesweeper}
In the game of Minesweeper, there is an $m\times n$ board which has exactly $k$ mines hidden. The aim is to ``clear'' the board by clicking on cells with no mine and avoiding clicking on any mine. By clicking on a cell with no mine, the player gets the number of neighbouring mines of that cell by the below rule
\begin{itemize}	
	\item If the cell $c$ is not at the boundary (\ref{fig:minecnb}) then it is the number of mines in a $3\times3$ square with that centre $c$.
	\item If the cell $c$ is at the boundary (\ref{fig:minecb1}, \ref{fig:minecb1}) even then $c$ cell is considered as the centre of $3\times3$ square; but, only some of the cells of the constructed square will lie inside the board.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Gray Code}
A gray code is a rearrangement of binary numbers such that any 2 consecutive numbers differ only in 1 bit.

A simple way to generate n-bit gray code is given below
\begin{itemize}	
	\item Start with an array of $2$ numbers $A = \{0, 1\}$
	\item Repeat the below steps $n-1$ times
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Reverse the array $A$ to get array $A^\prime$  and then append $A^\prime$  to $A$.
		\item Append $0$ to the left of the first half elements of $A$ and\\
		Append $1$ to the left of the second half elements of $A$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
